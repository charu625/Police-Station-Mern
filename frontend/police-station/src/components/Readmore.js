        <h2>CLASSIFICATION OF CRIMES</h2>
        <p>
          There are a variety of crimes that can be committed by individuals.
          Some crimes, such as murder or kidnapping, are considered serious
          crimes by society. Other crimes, such as speeding or trespassing, are
          not considered serious. Although all crimes mean a violation of the
          law, there's a wide range of punishments that can be imposed on a
          criminal. The classification of a crime is based on the extent of
          punishment that can be given for committing it. The punishment is
          usually based on the seriousness of the crime. States may differ as to
          the classification of any particular crime. A crime committed in one
          state may be classified differently than if it was committed in
          another state.
        </p>
        <h3>Crimes against the Person</h3>
        <p>
          A crime against the person is a crime that's committed using direct
          harm or force against the victim. Usually the most serious crimes,
          such as murder or rape, are crimes against the person. These crimes
          are many times felonies because of the seriousness of harming another
          person. However, some lower level crimes, such as harassment or
          assault without a weapon, may be considered misdemeanors
        </p>
        <h3>Crimes against Property</h3>
        <p>
          A crime against property is a crime that's committed by damaging or
          intruding on the property of the victim. Burglary and arson are two
          crimes against property that are normally felonies. Criminal mischief,
          which involves the intentional destruction of property, goes from a
          misdemeanor to a felony based on the value of the damage. Criminal
          trespass is usually classified as a misdemeanor
        </p><br></br>
        <h2>FELONY CRIMES</h2>
        <p>
          A felony is considered a serious crime. Most states and the federal
          government classify a crime that's punishable by more than one year in
          prison as a felony. Some states consider a felony as any crime that's
          punishable by any length of time in prison. A felony that's punishable
          by death is considered a capital crime. There are many different
          crimes that are considered felonies in most states. Some common
          felonies include: Murder, Rape, Burglary, Kidnapping, Arson and
          Robbery
        </p><br></br>
        <h2>MISDEMEANOR CRIMES</h2>
        <p>
          A misdemeanor is considered a less serious crime. Most states and the
          federal government classify a crime that's punishable by less than one
          year in prison as a misdemeanor. Some states consider a misdemeanor as
          any crime that's punishable only by fine or a small length of time in
          jail. If a misdemeanor is considered a very minor offense, such as
          jaywalking, the crime may be classified as a petty offense.
        </p><br></br>
        <h2>THEFT AND FRAUD CRIMES</h2>
        <p>
          There are a wide variety of theft and fraud crimes that involve
          illegally taking a victim's property. Whether a theft or a fraud crime
          is a misdemeanor or a felony usually depends on the value of the
          property stolen and the method used to commit the crime. A fraud crime
          is a crime in which deception is used to cause another person to
          suffer financial harm. Robbery, which is the taking of property from
          another using force, is classified as a felony.
